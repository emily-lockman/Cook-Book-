# Cook-Book- READ ME
This cookbook serves as a collection of useful data science techniques and sample code that I learned during the semester. It is intended to be a resource for me to refer to in the future when you need to recall how to perform specific tasks in data science. 

Currently, the cookbook only has one section, which is "01: Intro to Pandas (the Basics)". This section covers the fundamental concepts and ideas for using Pandas and Python. However, in the future, I plan to expand the cookbook into a series of recipes. These recipes will cover additional data science techniques that I deem helpful. Here is a preview of what it might look like: 
  - 01: Intro to Pandas (the Basics)
  - 02: Merging and Joining Data Frames 
  - 03: Comprehensive Plotting and Data Visulization 
  - 04: Data Scraping and APIs

In this first book, I created the following chapters and recipes:
  - 1.1 Importing Packages <br>
  - 1.2 Reading Files <br>
  - 1.3 Examining the DataFrame <br>
      - .head() function <br>
      - .tail() function <br>
      - Indexing columns <br>
      - .info() function <br>
      - .count() function <br>
      - .nunique() function <br>
      - .value_counts() function <br>
      - .min() function <br>
      - .max() function <br>
      - .mean() function <br>
  - 1.4 Adding a Column or Row <br>
  - 1.5 Plotting <br>
      - Simple Line Plot <br>
      - More Complex Horiontal Bar Chart <br>
  - 1.6 Defining and Implementing a Function <br>


Chapter 1.5, "Plotting," fulfills the requirement to present two distinct methods to achieve the same goal. To accomplish this, I have created two visualizations using different plotting techniques. The first visualization is a simple and straightforward example, meant to demonstrate an easy and efficient method for creating a plot. The second visualization is a more complex example, utilizing a different graph style to create a more sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing representation of the data. The purpose of this chapter is to showcase two distinct approaches to plotting, allowing the reader to choose which method works best for their specific needs.
